# Modbus Client

My Qt plugin made for reading XML and displaying info in the user-friendly interface.

### Model-View pattern
This was my first experience with the Qt Model-View pattern.

[![Model View](https://github.com/avovana/modbusClient/blob/master/model%20view.png?raw=true)](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/model-view-programming.html)

<br/>Plugin is embedded in the core system by the extending an [interfaces](https://github.com/avovana/modbusClient/tree/master/interfaces) with inheritance.
